# UiPath-API

Local and Cloud UiPath API functions

I'm starting with what I already have, which was the local and cloud authentication API process.
The local process is rather simple.
But at the time, the cloud was rather complex, and the documentation was hard to follow.

The cloud process has simplified a bit, but there's still room for improvement.
I'm likely reinventing the wheel a bit with this package, but it's also for learning purposes. 


This is my first module, and I'm by no means a python expert. 
Feel free to contribute, and constructive criticism is always welcome.
