# UiPath-API

Local and Cloud UiPath API functions

I'm starting with what I already know, which was the local and cloud authentication API process.
The local process is rather simple.
But at the time, the cloud was rather complex, and the documentation was hard to follow.

The cloud process has simplified a bit, but there's still room for improvement.
I'm likely reinventing the wheel a bit with this package, but it's also for learning purposes. 
I'm aiming to make this project OS independent, and compatible with the most recent 
python2 and all of 3.

This is my first module, and I'm by no means a python expert. 
Feel free to contribute, and constructive criticism is always welcome.

The future goal is to incorporate more of the UiPath API commands, 
and if possible, make the calls easier to work with or simplify their usage.
