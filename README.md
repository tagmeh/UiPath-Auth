# UiPath-API

Local and Cloud UiPath API functions

I'm starting with what I already know, which was the local and cloud authentication API process.
The local process is rather simple.
But at the time, the cloud was rather complex, and the documentation was hard to follow.

The cloud process has simplified a bit, but there's still room for improvement.
I'm likely reinventing the wheel a bit with this package, but it's also for learning purposes. 
A personal goal is to maintain compatibility with the most recent supported Python versions. 
As of 3/2/2020, uipath-api is compatible with Python 3.5+.

This is my first module, and I'm by no means a python expert. 
Feel free to contribute, and constructive criticism is always welcome.

The future goal is to incorporate more of the UiPath API commands, 
and if possible, make the calls easier to work with or simplify their usage.


Updated to the latest UiPath Cloud and Local authentication API version (as of 3/1/2020).
